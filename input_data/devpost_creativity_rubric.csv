Criterion,Description
Innovation,"Challenging the norm by analyzing existing solutions through testing or research, then exploring ways to improve or reinvent. This might look like a project that improves an existing solution in a way that increases value (access, affordability, opportunity, empowerment). It may also be a brand-new approach or potential solution that addresses a problem. Both cases involve a team identifying a problem and examining existing solutions."
Curiosity,"Being curious, asking questions that inspire growth and result in the artful application of scientific principles. This might look like a team that questioned existing limitations, a team that sought to discover an unaddressed problem, a project that is outside of the box, or a project that leveraged unique ideas and processes."
